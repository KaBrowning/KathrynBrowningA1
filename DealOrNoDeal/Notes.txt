Known bugs:
	1) When clicking on a case, the roundLabel and casesToOpenLabel both decrement. 
	2) Round 10
		- only the player's selected case shows up correctly
		- When clicking on the final case, it displays the banker's offer instead of what is contained in the case
	3) Refactoring needs to be done
